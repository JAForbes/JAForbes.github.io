?Framework?
===========

Small, Versatile, Capable MVI framework at < 16kb

Features
--------

- Persistent function state without closures or classes!
- Automatic destruction of streams on component change
- Components as streams
- Simple tiny API
- Modular: Ramda, Snabbdom, Flyd
- Fast: Snabbdom is a speedy virtual dom library, Flyd is one of the fastest stream libraries
- Efficient: only redraws when your model changes
- Intuitive
- A router that is just a stream of urls.
- Customizable Router

Inspiration
-----------

?Framework? is inspired by CycleJS's simplicity and mithril's component architecture.
I wrote this library because I wasn't into RxJS verbosity, CycleJS selectors in the DOM driver
and mithril's controller constructors and over abstraction over the diff lifecycle.

This library will feel very familiar to users of Mithril.  I believe it takes all the best ideas from both libraries.

Quick start
-----------

A simple ?Framework? app

```js
var h = require('./framework')

function Component(v){

	//v() lets you create streams
	var a = v(0)
	var b = v(1)

	//your view reacts to any changes to your model
	var model = h.merge(a,b)

	//this is an example of creating a child view stream
	var display = model.map(function(){
		return h('p', 'Sum of a + b',
			Number(a()) + Number(b())
		)
	})

	//display depends on a + b and view depends on display
	//therefore whenever a or b change, our view is updated
	var view = display.map(function(){

		return h('div', [
			//you can separate concerns
			//and arbitarily nest views and models
			labeled_input('a: ', a),
			labeled_input('b: ', b),

			//display is a stream
			//but but also a getter/setter function
			//here we call display to get the latest value
			//but you can also call them to set a value
			display()
		])

	})

	return view
}

// your views are just another
// representation of state
// you can identify patterns and create useful abstraction
function labeled_input(label, stream){
	return h('label', [
		label,

		//the virtual dom library is snabbdom
		//an extremely light weight vdom library
		h('input', {

			// here we are creating <input type="number">
			// with an event handler oninput, and setting the value
			// to the current value of the stream
			props: { type: 'number', value: stream() },
			on: { input: h.withAttr('value', stream) }
		})
	])
}


//There is a built in router, but you can roll your own
//just write a function that accepts a url stream as input
//and returns a component
var router = h.router('/home', {
	'/home' : Component
})

//this is a stream of urls
//it uses the history api behind the scenes
//it supports 3 modes hash/search/pathname
// (pathname requires server support)
var url = h.url('search')

// all v() streams will be garbage collected
// when your component is unmounted
h.route(container, url, router)

```
