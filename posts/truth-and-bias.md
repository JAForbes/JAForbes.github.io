Bias is unavoidable
===================

#### Bias

> Unfairly showing favoritism towards something or someone.

Bias is about what is selected and what is omitted.  And in order to communicate effectively, we need to continually decide what information to select and what information to omit in order form a cogent argument.

Bias is unavoidable.  And anytime we tell the truth we do so from within a context, a persepctive via selection and omission of information whether intentional or otherwise.

## Sampling bias

Let's take abortion as an example.  An advocate for abortion can cite factual statements about late term abortions, and PTSD of post-abortion mothers.  An anti-abortion advocate can cite factual statements on the prominence of rape, the negative impact on womens health, rights and opportunities were they forced to take a pregnancy to full term.  Both perspectives can claim the other is misrepresenting the issue.

Both citations may be factuat, but the particular choice of citation is bias.  The choice to focus on a particular angle of the story is inevitably going to shape the narrative and meta-narrative of the piece for the reader or viewer.  

There is no way to avoid this.  Citing both sides, is still a sample with a particular narrative and meta-narrative.  

I'm pro-choice.  I believe in a woman's right to control her own body.  I understand why some people view abortion as a complicated issue, but to me the consequences of making abortion illegal are so horrifying that it's very clear to me what the correct position is - that's my bias.

But even with that disclosure we run into problems, with terminology choice.  Do we say anti-abortion, or do we say anti-womens's rights.  Pro-life and pro-choice?  Is it a fetus or an unborn baby? Words have connotations, even citing both sides in a genuine dichotomy requires word choice to turn the cold hard numbers into a readable sentence. 

How far can we go to avoid bias?  Does excessive background information and context reduce the clarity of the original message, ultimately leading to a practical information loss?  Emotional language can make a boring topic more exciting and interesting (Death Tax!), but immediately makes it clear the piece is biased.

But cold scientific, centrist language is no less biased.  It's all just aesthetics, and each aesthetic choice has a motive.  News reporters on CNN wear suits for the same reasons actors wear labcoats in late-night miracle hairloss commercials.

If bias is unavoidable, why not use verbiage that is actually compelling and clear?

## Precise language and Transparent Bias

Bias is unavoidable, therefore claims of impartiality are merely a spectacle only harming the credibility of a news source.  Instead the best we can hope for is a clear and precise proclamation of an organization or source's bias.  

This transparent bias allows the source to instead focus on precise language in the context of it's own perspective.  The transparent bias allows the reader to create their own framing protocols and seek alternative and contrasting biases.  

In order words, be open and honest about your motivations and then, speak your mind.  It's just as unbiased as centrist theatre.

## Bias is good actually?

Bias is jus a context.  It's not good or bad, but it is unavoidable.  If we are open about our biases we can communicate with greater precision and concision and avoid symbolic and unnecessary addendums and inclusions to create the impression of an unbiased centrist position.

Who are your sponsors?  Who are your readers?  What is your background?  What are your politics, motivations and goals?

It's ok to have a bias, pretending that it's possible to have no position is a useful illusion to garner unearned authority.
